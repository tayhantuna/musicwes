1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,901
I'm an undesirable, I'm wanted

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,661
Why did you choose dark?

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,374
Dark will lose

4
00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:13,855
My way is lighting when your way is darkening

5
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:19,608
I'm not afraid of that dark way going to the light

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:23,658
No one can stop me at this way

7
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,274
I've lost my everything but I never stopped

8
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:29,729
I'm ready for everything after that

9
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:33,943
I can be anyone in anywhere but I'm undesirable here

10
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,215
Let's turn on the lights

11
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:38,343
(God knows I'm one)

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,890
I'm not afraid of that dark way going to the light

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,305
No one can stop me at this way(even you)

14
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,734
Light see now

15
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,900
Dark is  our mistake

16
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:51,121
We assembled

17
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,330
We will fight aganist dark

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,161
we are not afraid of that dark way going to the light

19
00:00:56,714 --> 00:01:00,161
No one can stop us at this way

20
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:02,391
Light won, dark lost

21
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:03,581
Light came first

22
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,585
Cities rising with sun

23
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,261
We won

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,729
(God knows we are together)

25
00:01:08,757 --> 00:01:10,854
Don't miss the light

26
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:12,686
Get it
